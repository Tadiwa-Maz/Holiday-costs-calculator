First, get the following user inputs:

○ city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some options for them. Remember each city will have different flight costs.)
○ num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
○ rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.

● Next, NOTE the following four functions:
● hotel_cost: This function will take num_nights as an argument, and return a total cost for the hotel stay (You can choose the price per night charged at the hotel).
● plane_cost: This function will take city_flight as an argument and return a cost for the flight (hint: use if-elif-else statements in the function to retrieve a price based on the chosen city).
● car_rental: This function will take rental_days as an argument and return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily rental cost.)
● holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your holiday.

● Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way!

● Try using your program with different combinations of input to show its compatibility with different options.
